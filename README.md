Above should be a screenshot of me using reverse\_complement.py. I copied it into a folder called boot_strap.
So many issues everywhere. Need more time. Need less coffee. 
</p>

<p>
Will try to use vim for editing Python code, but in general it seems that I will continue to stray into using Idlex as it has numbered lines and has a friendly gui. I can see how vim would be able to navigate the file much faster, but it is still new territory so we'll see. I also have a hard time navigating in Ubuntu at all seeing as I have no idea where any files are.

<h1> Development Environment </h1>

<p>
I no longer have a window....
</p>

<p>
  No seriously (O.O). 
  My window is pretty much paint over hollow spaces. Darn termites.
</p>

<p>
  Anyway, I have Ubuntu installed in my laptop now; fear new territory I do. 
  Took me forever. 
  Every site online had such convoluted steps. 
  Most of these sites were for dual-boot of Ubuntu and Windows on the same laptop. 
  At this point I am regretting not going down that path. 
  Well I have an Ubuntu now so I gotta live with it. 
</p>

<p>
I have installed Python 2.7.10 and Anaconda 2.3.0. 
I intend to use them in some form for the class.
</p>

<p>
In addition I have installed idlex as an... IDE. Oh, will you look at that. 
Is that what you're looking for? 
Anyway I found idlex as a modified version of the interpreter that comes with python by default
It makes making .py files much smoother(command lines scare me)(gotta use command lines to open it up though)
</p>

<p>
I intend to follow the teachings and tutorials of Al Sweigart. 
He has a few books on using python and pygame for making simple games.
Most importantly his books come free as .pdf files on his site.

Awaiting week 3.

Ok, so my name is Andy C.
This is my first time using github so I am trying to learn how to work with it. 
This edit to the read-me was made as practice towards making and editing branches in a repository.
I hope I am getting it down >.>.
