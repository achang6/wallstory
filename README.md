Above should be a screenshot of me using reverse\_complement.py. I copied it into a folder called boot_strap.
So many issues everywhere. Need more time. Need less coffee. 

Will try to use vim for editing Python code. I can see how vim would be able to navigate the file much faster, but it is still new territory so we'll see. I also have a hard time navigating in Ubuntu at all seeing as I have no idea where any files are. Need sleep. Then I'm going to have to jump into tutorials for a season or two. 


# Development Environment 

I no longer have a window....

No seriously (O.O). 
My window is pretty much paint over hollow spaces. Darn termites.

Anyway, I have Ubuntu installed in my laptop now; fear new territory I do. 
Took me forever. 
Every site online had such convoluted steps. 
Most of these sites were for dual-boot of Ubuntu and Windows on the same laptop. 
At this point I am regretting not going down that path. 
Well I have an Ubuntu now so I gotta live with it. 

I have installed Python 2.7.10 and Anaconda 2.3.0. 
I intend to use them in some form for the class.

In addition I have installed idlex as an... IDE. Oh, will you look at that. 
Is that what you're looking for? 
Anyway I found idlex as a modified version of the interpreter that comes with python by default
It makes making .py files much smoother(command lines scare me)(gotta use command lines to open it up though)

I intend to follow the teachings and tutorials of <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/" >Al Sweigart</a>.
He has a few books on using python and pygame for making simple games.
Most importantly his books come free as .pdf files on his site. 

Awaiting week 3.

# wallstory

Ok, so my name is Andy C.
This is my first time using github so I am trying to learn how to work with it. 
This edit to the read-me was made as practice towards making and editing branches in a repository.
I hope I am getting it down >.>.
